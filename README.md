                                                    FLASK QUIZ 
   The Quiz Web Application is a dynamic and interactive tool built with Flask, a lightweight Python web framework.                                                 It is designed to test users' knowledge in AI development, focusing on key topics such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and AI model implementation.                                                                                                                                                  
The application provides instant feedback by calculating and displaying scores immediately after submission, 
with the highest score prominently featured in the top-right corner. It also has a responsive design, enhanced with custom CSS for a smooth user experience.  Hosted on PythonAnywhere.com, the project can be easily run locallyâ€”simply clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and start the Flask server.
